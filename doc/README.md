# Introduction

See the [gallery](README-gallery.md) for examples of figures created
by this library that demonstrate aspects of the Java VM or Clojure's
implementation that I find interesting.

[README-dev.md](README-dev.md) contains a few notes on the
implementation of the `cljol` library itself.
